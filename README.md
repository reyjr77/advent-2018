These are the solutions to adventcode2018 as far as I have gone up to. Files uploaded are finalized solutions, however this repo is still a work in progress as I complete more problems.

I'll try to complete them all in Javascript since it's the easiest language for anybody to execute as it requires no setup.

Requirements:
- Browser
- Developer mode activated if using Safari. Google and Firefox are always on by default. (Command+Alt+i)/(Control+Alt+i)

That's literally it. 

- Open the puzzle input on a new tab.
- In that tab, Activate the Developer toolbar
- Copy and paste the js code into the console
